# W.W.Weather App

1. First task is solved in `/src/services/weatherService.js`.
2. Second task result can be found on main weather tab.
3. Third is a section below Forecast, called "Statistics". In this section I am showing temperature and humidity data forecast for next 15 hours.

Features:

- Form validation
- Simple responsivity
- Error handling
- REST API handling using `axios`
- Logger concept
- 404 page

Please run `npm i` to install all dependencies and then:

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
